# Werner Kruger – Web Developer & Aspiring Software Developer

I am a Web Developer with several years of professional experience building, maintaining, and optimizing websites using **WordPress, WooCommerce, and Shopify**. My work spans front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), SEO optimization, performance tuning, security best practices, and direct client collaboration.  

In addition to my CMS expertise, I am actively transitioning toward a **software-focused role** through structured full-stack development studies in the **.NET ecosystem**, including backend APIs, Blazor front-end integration, and general full-stack project work.

This repository serves as a **comprehensive portfolio**, showcasing:

- Professional WordPress and Shopify project case studies  
- Structured full-stack and .NET learning projects  
- Clear documentation of responsibilities, problem-solving, and project outcomes

- Case studies focus on responsibilities, problem-solving, and outcomes rather than source code ownership.
