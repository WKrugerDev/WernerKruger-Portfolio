# Werner Kruger – Web Developer & Aspiring Software Developer

I am a Web Developer with several years of professional experience building, maintaining, and optimizing websites using WordPress, WooCommerce, and Shopify. My background includes front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), SEO optimization, performance tuning, security best practices, and direct client collaboration. These projects also demonstrate applied front-end and full-stack development skills in real-world CMS environments, complementing my programming-focused work.

Alongside my professional web development work, I am actively transitioning toward a more software-focused role through structured full-stack development studies using the .NET ecosystem.

This repository serves as a portfolio overview, showcasing:
- Professional WordPress and Shopify project case studies
- Ongoing full-stack and .NET learning projects
- Clear documentation of responsibilities and contributions
