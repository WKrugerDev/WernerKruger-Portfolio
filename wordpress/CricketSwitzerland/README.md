# Project: Cricket Switzerland (WordPress)

**Role:** Web Developer – Full Build & Ongoing Maintenance  
**Platform:** WordPress  
**Page Builder:** Divi  

**Live Site:** https://cricketswitzerland.ch/

## Project Overview

Cricket Switzerland is the official website of the national cricket organization, serving multiple audiences including administrators, players, national teams, domestic leagues, and the general public.

I was responsible for the **original full build** of the website and have continued to provide long-term maintenance and updates. The project reflects an earlier stage of my professional development and has since informed many improvements in how I approach architecture, performance, and scalability today.

## Responsibilities

- Designed and built the complete WordPress website using Divi
- Worked with the client to define site structure, navigation, and content priorities
- Implemented responsive layouts and cross-device compatibility
- Maintained and updated pages, posts, and media content
- Implemented SEO best practices and improved content structure
- Configured caching, security, and SEO plugins
- Troubleshot plugin conflicts and resolved technical issues
- Maintained email delivery and SMTP configuration following Google security changes
- Collaborated with the client on ongoing content, imagery, and structural updates

## Scale & Structural Considerations

Over time, the site grew to support multiple functional areas:
- Organizational content
- National team content
- Domestic cricket content

This resulted in a large number of pages, deep navigation hierarchies, and complex menus. In later years, discussions shifted toward a **future rebuild**, including the potential separation into multiple focused sites to improve usability, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Due to budget constraints and the planned rebuild, current work focuses on:
- Content updates requested by the client
- Structural fixes where needed
- Stability and security rather than deep performance refactoring

## Reflection & Professional Growth

While the site performs its required function and continues to serve its audience, this project represents valuable real-world learning in:

- Designing for long-term growth
- Managing content-heavy websites
- Understanding when architectural limits justify a rebuild
- Balancing ideal solutions with commercial realities

These lessons directly inform how I approach newer builds and technical decisions today.
