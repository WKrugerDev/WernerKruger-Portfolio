# Project: Cricket Switzerland  
Platform: WordPress  
Live URL: https://cricketswitzerland.ch/  
Role: Web Developer – Original Build & Ongoing Maintenance

## Project Overview
Cricket Switzerland is a large WordPress website supporting a national sports organization with diverse content needs, including organizational information, national teams, domestic competitions, fixtures, and news.

I was responsible for the original site build, including layout implementation and design input, and have continued to support the platform through long-term maintenance, updates, and technical improvements. Over time, the site has evolved significantly as the organization’s content and structural requirements expanded.


## Responsibilities
- Built the original WordPress site using Divi, implementing layouts and design suggestions based on client goals and available content
- Maintained and updated pages, posts, and structured content using the existing theme and layout system
- Implemented SEO best practices to improve content structure, metadata consistency, and crawlability
- Configured and maintained caching, security, and performance-related plugins
- Troubleshot plugin conflicts, layout issues, technical issues and site stability concerns
- Maintained and updated SMTP/email delivery following Google and provider security changes
- Collaborated closely with the client on content updates, images, and navigation adjustments
- Supported gradual structural improvements while maintaining production stability

## Architectural & Design Evolution
The site has grown significantly over time as content, competitions, and organizational needs expanded. This resulted in a large, multi-purpose platform with extensive subpages and complex navigation structures.

Through long-term ownership of the project, I’ve developed a clear understanding of:
- How early architectural decisions affect long-term scalability
- When incremental performance optimisation is appropriate versus when a rebuild delivers better ROI
- The importance of aligning technical improvements with budget, timelines, and client priorities

Current discussions focus on a future rebuild strategy to better separate organizational, national team, and domestic cricket content, while ongoing work prioritizes stability, accuracy, and relevant content updates.

## Tools & Technologies
