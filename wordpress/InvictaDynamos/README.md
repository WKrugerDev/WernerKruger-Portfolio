**Role:** Web Developer – Full Build & Long-Term Maintenance  
**Platform:** WordPress  
**Page Builder:** Divi  
**Primary Plugin:** SportsPress

## Project Overview

Invicta Dynamos is a competitive ice hockey club with a strong emphasis on detailed historical statistics, fixtures, and player data. The website was built to support both fans and internal stakeholders by providing accurate, long-term statistical records alongside regular news and seasonal updates.

I was responsible for the full website build, working closely with the client to balance visual design, usability, and the significant functional requirements needed to support historical and ongoing sports data.

## Responsibilities

- Built the complete WordPress website using Divi, from initial structure through launch
- Collaborated closely with the client to translate functional priorities (statistics, fixtures, player profiles) into a coherent and usable website
- Implemented and configured **SportsPress** to manage:
  - Player profiles
  - Team and player statistics
  - Match fixtures and results
  - Season-based and lifetime statistical records
- Worked with the client to validate statistical accuracy, ensuring:
  - Correct calculation logic
  - Clear separation of seasonal vs lifetime data
  - Accurate percentages and aggregate values across views
- Extensively customized SportsPress output using CSS to align plugin-generated templates with the site’s overall design
- Provided training and guidance to the club’s statistics manager for accurate ongoing data entry
- Assisted with initial data population near launch while focusing on final refinements and client-requested adjustments

## Data & Functional Complexity

The site supports:

- Player and team statistics spanning more than a decade
- Historical fixture records extending back to early seasons
- Automated data relationships where individual data entries propagate across multiple areas of the site (profiles, tables, fixtures, and archives)

Ensuring data consistency and accuracy required careful plugin configuration, validation of calculations, and close collaboration with the client during setup and testing.

## Ongoing Maintenance & Evolution

- Provided full site maintenance for several years following launch
- Supported recurring seasonal updates, including:
  - Creating new season pages
  - Archiving previous seasons correctly
  - Maintaining historical data integrity
- Transitioned to a reduced support role once the client brought media management in-house
- Currently provide:
  - Technical fixes when issues arise
  - Structural updates or new pages upon request
  - Annual season rollovers and archive management

## Design & Decision Context

While cleaner or more minimal design approaches were sometimes considered, final design decisions were guided by the client’s priority for data visibility and functional depth. These choices reflect how the site is actively used by the team and its supporters.

This project demonstrates practical experience balancing:

- Design preferences versus functional requirements
- CMS flexibility versus plugin constraints
- Long-term maintainability for non-technical users
