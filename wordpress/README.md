# WordPress Development Portfolio

This section highlights my professional WordPress experience gained through full website builds and long-term maintenance projects while working at **Key & Eagle**.

My work spans complete site builds, bespoke client solutions, and ongoing maintenance for production websites with real users, real traffic, and real constraints such as budgets, timelines, and evolving client needs.

Rather than focusing purely on visuals, these case studies emphasize:
- Practical decision-making
- Functional requirements
- Performance, security, and maintainability
- Collaboration with non-technical stakeholders
- Long-term ownership of live systems

## Core Responsibilities Across Projects

## Notes

- All projects link to publicly accessible live websites
- No proprietary source code or confidential data is included
- Case studies focus on responsibilities, constraints, and outcomes rather than code ownership

## Additional Production Experience

In addition to the featured case studies above, I regularly supported and updated a wider portfolio of client websites at Key & Eagle.

This included:
- Maintaining and updating existing sites originally built by other developers
- Managing seasonal fixture updates, content changes, and structural adjustments
- Troubleshooting layout, plugin, and performance issues on live production sites
- Ensuring ongoing stability, security, and content accuracy across multiple client properties

These sites are not individually documented here, as my work focused on targeted updates and operational support rather than full ownership or complete rebuilds.
