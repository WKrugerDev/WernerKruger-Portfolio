## Ongoing Optimization Awareness

Across long-term production sites, my responsibilities often focused on stability, uptime, and client-priority delivery within budget and time constraints.

As my experience has grown, I actively evaluate past projects for:
- Additional performance optimizations (Core Web Vitals, asset loading, caching strategies)
- Improved component reuse and layout efficiency
- Enhanced accessibility and mobile usability
- Cleaner separation between content, layout, and logic

This mindset reflects how I approach current and future projects: iterative improvement, measurable gains, and maintainable solutions.
