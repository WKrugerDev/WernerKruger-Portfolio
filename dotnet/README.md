# .NET & Full-Stack Learning Projects

This folder contains all my structured full-stack development projects using the .NET ecosystem. 

It is included as a **submodule**, pointing to a separate repository: [fullstack-course-projects](https://github.com/YourUsername/fullstack-course-projects)

---

## Overview

- All projects are organized as individual folders within the submodule
- Focus areas include backend development, APIs, authentication, and frontend integration
- Projects demonstrate problem-solving, clean code practices, and hands-on learning with the .NET ecosystem

---

## Notes

- The submodule will be updated periodically as I progress through my full-stack course
- Each project within the submodule contains its own README.md with project-specific details
- This setup ensures my portfolio stays current without duplicating all course files
